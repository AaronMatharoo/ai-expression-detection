# Facial Expression Detection

This is a relatively simple implementation of a facial expression recognition API. This was a quick, fun project showcasing my ability to use an API such as this and implement it successfully.

# NOTE from Face-API

For those wanting to replicate this project, there is something to keep in mind. `navigator.getUserMedia` has been deprecated and instead, we are told to use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`. If you are attempting this yourself, we are told to replace all instances of `navigator.getUserMedia` with the new: `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.
